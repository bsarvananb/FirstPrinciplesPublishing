# Getting Started with App

## Steps to run the app

- Node enviornment setup is required to run the app
- Download the app and checkout to the folder
- run `npm install` and then `npm start`
- This will open the app in http://localhost:3000

- Chart.js library is used to plot the graph
- x-axis is time and y-axios is values
- There is date range picker at the bottom. By this we can modify the time period for the graph

## Available Scripts
